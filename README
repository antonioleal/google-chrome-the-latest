Maintaining an updated chrome browser on Slackware is now made
easier with this small program, "google-chrome-the-latest".
It is a simple python script that checks what is the latest
version available and updates it on your Slackware box.

It does this by parsing the web-page at
https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/the-latest-version/chrome
and comparing with the chrome version currently installed.

Chrome is downloaded directly from Google and converted to txz
using the standard rpm2txz command.

You can run this script manually or automatically with the
provided cron.hourly script.
This cron script will attempt to identify which user to notify,
otherwise you can force the variable to USERNAME=’your username’

Normally it is asked if you want to install new version, but
providing the argument "silent" will just update with no
human intervention.
